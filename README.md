# School District Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to go through school district information for the year, and provide several snapshots and overviews showing the following:

1. High-level snapshot of the district's key metrics.
2. Overview of key metrics for each school.
3. Tables showing:
- Top 5 and bottom 5 performing shocols, based on overall passing rate
- The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
- The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
- School performance based on the budget per student
- School performance based on the school size 
- School performance based on the type of school

We utilized Jupyter Notebook to write the script.

Once we finished the initial analysis, we were informed that there were signs of academic dishonesty for a specific grade and school (Thomas High School, 9th grade). We then had to refactor the script to reflect updated results that replaced all grades for Thomas High School - 9th grade to NaN.
